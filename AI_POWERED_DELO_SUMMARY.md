---

## 🚀 **Core AI Features Implemented**

### 1. **Spell Correction & Typo Handling**
- **Auto-corrects user input** using the `natural` library
- **Handles common mistakes**: "opne gmal" → "open gmail"
- **Never fails silently** on typos or misspellings
- **Example**: "schedle mtng for tmr abt delo lauch" → "schedule meeting for tomorrow about delo launch"

### 2. **Fuzzy Command Matching**
- **Levenshtein distance** for command matching
- **Synonym support**: "send" ≈ "email" ≈ "compose" ≈ "message"
- **Confidence scoring** with 70% threshold
- **Partial match suggestions**: "Did you mean...?"
- **Example**: "compose message to team" → email command

### 3. **Workflow Automation**
- **One-click complex workflows**: "process meeting notes" → summarize + email + calendar
- **Multi-step automation** with conditional logic
- **Workflow templates** for common tasks
- **Auto-generated workflows** from detected patterns
- **Example**: "research this topic" → search + summarize + save

### 4. **Pattern Detection & Learning**
- **AI-powered pattern mining** from user actions
- **Automatic workflow suggestions** based on habits
- **Productivity scoring** and insights
- **Context-aware recommendations**
- **Example**: Detects "summarize → email → calendar" pattern and suggests automation

### 5. **Voice Control**
- **Speech-to-text integration** (browser-based, Whisper, Azure, Google)
- **Hotword detection**: "Hey DELO..."
- **Voice command routing** to all DELO features
- **Hands-free automation**
- **Example**: "Hey DELO, process meeting notes" → executes workflow

### 6. **LLM-Based Recovery**
- **AI-powered command correction** when parsing fails
- **EnhancedAIPromptingService** for intelligent suggestions
- **Fallback prompts** for unclear commands
- **Context-aware rephrasing**
- **Example**: "do the thing with the stuff" → AI suggests specific action
